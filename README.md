# ever-crisis-gacha-simulator

This project uses Monte Carlo simulation and data analysis to help players of Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis make better decisions with their currency, whether they rely solely on the game's free currency (crystals) or supplement their gameplay using real-world money. The project is a Python package, so feel free to install and run it on your own machine if you'd like!

For non-players who are simply interested in the project's use case(s) and technical implementation, please feel free to check out the [Non-Player Walkthrough Notebook](https://github.com/Jace743/ever-crisis-gacha-simulator/blob/main/analyses/non_player_walkthrough.ipynb), as well as browse the source code at your leisure. 

For players who are interested in answers to FAQs, feel free to check out the [Standard and Limit Break Banner analysis notebook](https://github.com/Jace743/ever-crisis-gacha-simulator/blob/main/analyses/standard_and_lb_banner_faqs.ipynb). You're welcome to browse the source code too, of course!
